# Auto-Insurance-Fraud-Detection

In today's world, the surge in criminal activities demands advanced solutions. Financial crimes, particularly fraud, have become a significant concern. Our project, 'Auto Insurance Fraud Detection using C# and Machine Learning,' addresses the escalating issue of insurance fraud. The insurance industry grapples with both hard and soft fraud, where individuals intentionally fabricate accidents or falsify legitimate claims. By leveraging machine learning, our system streamlines fraud detection, enhancing the overall fraud management process in the insurance sector. A robust fraud detection and prevention system not only safeguards insurers but also contributes to increased customer satisfaction by minimizing false claims and reducing loss adjustment expenses. With machine learning techniques, we aim to revolutionize fraud detection, making it more efficient and less resource-intensive.
